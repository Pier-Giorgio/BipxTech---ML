# BIPxTech-TeamSystem: Analysis of Iva data and implement of Machine learning model

**Introduction**
In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model capable of determining the VAT exemption code (IvaM) for each line item in an invoice, leveraging the information from other fields within the same line item. The accurate prediction of VAT exemption codes is crucial for financial accuracy, regulatory compliance, and efficient invoice processing in various business contexts.
Ensuring financial accuracy through correctly predicting VAT exemption codes is crucial for maintaining the integrity of financial records. This accuracy helps prevent costly errors and discrepancies that could arise from incorrect VAT calculations. Moreover, automating the prediction of VAT exemption codes enhances operational efficiency by streamlining the invoicing process. This automation reduces the time and effort required for manual entry and validation, leading to faster processing times, lower administrative costs, and improved overall productivity.
Invoices typically contain a wealth of information spread across multiple fields, such as product descriptions, articles, and various tax-related details. The challenge is to utilize this multi-dimensional data effectively to predict the correct VAT exemption code. Our dataset includes these fields, with the "IvaM" column serving as the target variable for our predictions.
The project involves several key stages, starting from the initial data exploration and pre-processing to the development, evaluation, and implementation of the predictive model. Each stage is critical to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the final model. Below, we outline the main objectives and tasks undertaken:
    •	**Data exploration and analysis**: the initial phase involves a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to understand its structure, identify key features, and address any anomalies such as missing or unmapped 
    values. This step is essential for setting a solid foundation for subsequent modeling efforts.
    •	**Data pre-processing**: this step involves cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features; effective pre-processing is crucial for enhancing 
    the model's performance.
    •	**Model development**: the core of the project is the development of the predictive model. Machine learning algorithms such as random forests and artificial neural networks are explored so as to find the 
    model best suited to our goal. The choice of the final model is based on a thorough evaluation of their performance on the validation dataset.
    •	**Model evaluation**: the selected model is rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy and test loss. Comparisons between identical models but made up of different structures are also 
    used to understand and guarantee the best possible reliability and stability of performance for the chosen model.
    •	**User interface development**: to facilitate user interaction with the model, a simple and intuitive user interface is developed. This interface allows users to input invoice line item details and receive        predicted VAT exemption codes in real-time.
